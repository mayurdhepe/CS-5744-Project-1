**Project Title:** Pet Adoption and Medical Record System

**Authors:** Daniel Slutsky, Jonathan Dixon, Wenjia Song

## Background

According to the 2019-2020 APPA National Pet Owners Survey, 67% of U.S. households own a pet, which equates to 84.9 million homes.\[1\] The type of pets includes but not limited to dog, cat, bird, freshwater fish, saltwater fish, horse, and reptile. However, there is no centralized medical record system existing at this time to help shelters, veterinarians, and pet owners access a complete medical record of the animals and update the record. Current systems that track medical information for animals are fragmented. Veterinarians and adoption shelters maintain separate records, which makes it difficult to piece together an animal's history. If an animal transfers between veterinarians or shelters, their medical history may not travel with them. This system aims to solve this problem through a centralized medical record system.

## Goals

- Securely and centrally store animal medical records and owner information.
- Allow veterinarians and owners easy access to complete records.
- Give veterinarians the ability to modify records and have the changes be immediately visible to users
- Allow owners to update personal information
- Notify owners of upcoming/needed medication or procedures via text message and/or email
